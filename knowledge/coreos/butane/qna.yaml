  - question: What is CoreOS's Butane project?
    answer: |
      Butane (formerly the Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler) is a tool that
      consumes a Butane Config and produces an Ignition Config, which is a JSON
      document that can be given to a Fedora CoreOS machine when it first boots.
      Using this config, a machine can be told to create users, create
      filesystems, set up the network, install systemd units, and more.
      Butane configs are YAML files conforming to Butane's schema.
  - question: How can I use Butane to create an Ignition Config?
    answer: |
      Butane can be run from a container image with podman or docker, installed
      from Fedora package repositories, or downloaded as a standalone binary.
      Using the official container images is the recommended option.
  - question: How can I use Butane using the official container images?
    answer: |
      # Pull the latest release
      podman pull quay.io/coreos/butane:release

      # Run Butane using standard in and standard out
      podman run -i --rm quay.io/coreos/butane:release --pretty --strict < your_config.bu > transpiled_config.ign

      # Run Butane using files
      podman run --rm -v /path/to/your_config.bu:/config.bu:z quay.io/coreos/butane:release --pretty \
       --strict /config.bu > transpiled_config.ign
  - question: Can I use Butane using an alias?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can create an alias that looks like this:
      alias butane='podman run --rm --interactive         \
              --security-opt label=disable          \
              --volume "${PWD}":/pwd --workdir /pwd \
              quay.io/coreos/butane:release'
  - question: Give an example of a Butane config file.
    answer: |
      variant: fcos
      version: 1.1.0
      passwd:
        users:
          - name: core
            ssh_authorized_keys:
              - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc...
  - question: What is the command to make an Ignition config from my Butane file.bu?
    answer: |
      butane --pretty --strict ./file.bu > file.ign
  - question: How can I validate my config file for Ignition?
    answer: |
      # This example uses podman, but docker can be used too
      podman run --pull=always --rm -i quay.io/coreos/ignition-validate:release - < file.ign
  - question: What is a Butane Config?
    answer: |
      A Butane Config is a file written in YAML format that describes how to set
      up a Fedora CoreOS machine, including users, files, and network settings.
      Butane config can produce an Ignition Config, a file written in JSON
      format that can be given to a Fedora CoreOS machine when it first boots.
  - question: What is an Ignition Config?
    answer: |
      An Ignition Config is a JSON document generated from a Butane Config that
      tells a Fedora CoreOS machine how to configure itself when it first boots.
  - question: What is YAML?
    answer: |
      YAML is a human-readable data format often used for writing configuration
      files. It is easier to read and write than JSON.
  - question: What is JSON?
    answer: |
      JSON is a lightweight data format used for data exchange, structured in
      key-value pairs. It is more complex and less readable than YAML.
  - question: What is Podman?
    answer: |
      Podman is a daemonless, open-source, and Linux-native tool designed for
      managing, finding, running, building, sharing, and deploying
      containerized applications.
  - question: What is Docker?
    answer: |
      Docker is another popular tool for managing containers, similar to Podman,
      that allows you to create, run, and manage containerized applications.
